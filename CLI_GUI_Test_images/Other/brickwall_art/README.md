## 4. Printing Recommendations

*   **Printer Type**: Optimized for thermal printers (Direct Thermal or Thermal Transfer) with an 8.5" print head.
*   **Dithering Settings**: The choice of dither profile is critical for balancing the detail of the animals with the texture of the brick wall background.
    *   **Floyd** (Floyd-Steinberg): **This is the highly recommended profile** for this type of image. It will provide the most natural-looking texture for the brick wall while preserving the fine details and smooth shading of the larks and elephants.
    *   **Bayer**: This profile will create a more uniform, grid-like pattern. It can be an interesting stylistic choice for the brick texture but may make the animals appear less realistic.
    *   **Threshold**: This will remove all gray tones, converting the image to pure black and white. This will likely eliminate the brick wall texture and most of the shading on the animals, creating a high-contrast, stencil-like graphic. Use this only if that specific effect is intended.
