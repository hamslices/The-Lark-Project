## 4. Printing Recommendations

*   **Printer Type**: Designed for thermal printers (Direct Thermal or Thermal Transfer) with an 8.5" print head.
*   **Material**: Use with 8.5-inch wide compatible thermal roll stock.
*   **Dithering Settings**: To produce the sharpest, cleanest lines for the mazes, it is highly recommended to use the **Threshold** dither profile in your printing software. The "Bayer" or "Floyd" profiles will introduce dot patterns that can soften the edges of the artwork.
