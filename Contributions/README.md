## Bringing Lark to Life: The Prototype

The Lark project has reached an exciting milestone. The hardware and mechanical designs are complete, and the project is ready to move from the digital screen to a physical, working prototype. This is the most critical phase for validating the design, creating assembly guides, and providing a proven foundation for others to build upon.

To assemble this first official prototype, a few key things are needed. Your support at this stage would be instrumental in making this open-source project a reality.

**Current Needs:**

*   **The Bill of Materials (BOM):** This includes all the electronic components (resistors, capacitors, microcontrollers, etc.) required to populate the custom controller PCB.
*   **Mechanical Hardware:** A set of specific nuts, bolts, and other fasteners are needed to assemble the printer's enclosure and mount the components securely.
*   **Odds and Ends:** This covers miscellaneous but essential items like wiring, connectors, and thermal paper for testing.

**How You Can Help**

Contributions toward acquiring these initial components will directly fund the construction and testing of the first Lark printer. This will enable the creation of:

*   **A fully validated and tested hardware design.**
*   **High-quality photos and videos for documentation and assembly guides.**
*   **A confirmed and verified Bill of Materials for the community.**
*   **The final, polished open-source release that others can build with confidence.**

Thank you for being a part of this journey. Every bit of support helps push this project closer to the finish line.
