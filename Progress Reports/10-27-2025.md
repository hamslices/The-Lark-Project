#### **I. Overall Summary**

Work is progressing while awaiting the arrival of key hardware components. In the interim, development has focused on software and repository maintenance. Confidence in the software, particularly the GUI and API, is high. However, there are some reservations regarding the hardware, specifically the power section and potential sensor noise, which will require thorough testing and debugging upon receipt of the boards.

#### **II. Hardware**

*   **Status:**
    *   Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) and 3D printed parts are currently in fabrication and their delivery is awaited.
    *   Procurement of the necessary electronic components is pending.

*   **Concerns & Risks:**
    *   **Power Section:** There are significant concerns about the power delivery system on the PCB.
        *   The close proximity of the switching regulator to the ATtiny microcontroller may introduce noise or interference.
        *   The linear regulator is expected to generate a notable amount of heat.
        *   The layout of the switching mode regulator is a primary concern, although efforts were made to adhere to the recommended application notes.
    *   **Motor Thermistor:** There is uncertainty about the potential for electrical noise affecting the motor thermistor readings, which could impact temperature measurements.

#### **III. Software**

*   **Firmware:**
    *   The firmware is operational on the development kit, which is a positive indicator.
    *   It is anticipated that a considerable amount of debugging will be necessary once the firmware is deployed on the final custom hardware.

*   **GUI & API:**
    *   Confidence in both the Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Application Programming Interface (API) is high.

*   **Supporting Tools & Repository:**
    *   The associated tooling is believed to be functioning correctly.
    *   Ongoing maintenance has been performed on the project's repository to finalize miscellaneous items.

#### **IV. Next Steps**

1.  Receive the fabricated boards and 3D printed parts.
2.  Once parts are procured, begin assembly of the hardware.
3.  Prioritize testing of the power section to validate its performance and address the layout concerns.
4.  Deploy the firmware to the new hardware and commence debugging.
5.  Investigate the motor thermistor for noise and implement mitigation strategies if required.
