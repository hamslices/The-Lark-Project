# Welcome to the Lark Project

Hello and welcome! This repository serves as the central hub and landing page for the entire Lark project.

![alt text](https://github.com/hamslices/The-Lark-Project/blob/main/img/lark_advert_2.png?raw=true)

Lark is a comprehensive system designed for controlling the Fujitsu FTP-68EMCL112-R thermal printer, encompassing everything from custom hardware to a user-friendly graphical interface.

This central repository is also used to store project-wide assets, including invoices, photos, and other documentation related to the development of the Lark project.

## Potential Applications

The Lark system is engineered to excel at printing from a single, **uninterrupted data stream**. Because printing is directly tied to the data flow, it is perfect for applications where a complete print job can be generated by the host software and fed to the printer continuously.

This makes it ideal for a variety of specialized and embedded use cases:

*   **Medical and Scientific Instrumentation**
    A prime use case. Devices like EKG/ECG machines or seismographs produce a constant, uninterrupted stream of data, which Lark can translate directly into a real-time paper trace without buffering or page breaks.

*   **High-Throughput Stream Logging**
    Perfect for applications that generate a constant flow of log data, such as high-frequency sensor monitoring, industrial process logging, or network traffic analysis, creating a continuous physical record.

*   **Transactional and Batch Printing (POS, Kiosks, Documents)**
    For applications like receipts, tickets, or long manifests, the host software generates the full document in memory first and then sends it to Lark as one continuous stream, ensuring a clean, unbroken printout for each job.

*   **Creative and Artistic Projects**
    Artists and makers can generate complex, long-form patterns or generative art and stream the final output to the printer to create seamless banners and scrolls that are not limited by a fixed page length.

## Project Motivation and Development

The driving force behind the Lark project has been a genuine passion for creating and a sense of excitement in building something new. It was born out of a specific need and a gap in the open-source community, where virtually no public repositories on GitHub offered a complete, end-to-end thermal printer solution that included both hardware and software designs. Furthermore, there was a personal requirement for a large-format thermal printer capable of continuous printing, rather than being limited to page-by-page jobs.

The development approach began with using as many off-the-shelf components as possible, like the PSU and print mechanism, allowing the focus to be on the custom controller boardâ€”the "brains" of the operation. A core philosophy was to design the simplest possible hardware without compromising on capability. To this end, KiCad was chosen for the PCB design due to its powerful, open-source, and free nature, which is perfectly suited for multi-layer board design.

With the goals of hand-assembly, cost-reduction, and usability at the forefront, many specific design choices were made. Most components are 0603 package size, the smallest that can be reasonably managed for hand-soldering. While alternative hardware designs were possible, this approach ensures the project remains accessible, affordable, and practical for creators.

A key feature of the Lark print engine is its intentional lack of external memory. This cost-saving measure created a significant advantage: the ability to print data streams as they are received, instead of buffering a full job in memory. This makes Lark perfectly suited for long, continuous printing tasks. It's also important to note that Lark does not use a conventional, and often messy, Windows print driver. Instead, it offers a clean Windows API for seamless integration into OEM software. While a traditional print driver may be a goal for the future, it is beyond the current scope of the project.

## Project Repositories

The Lark project is divided into several focused repositories. Each component is developed and maintained independently and contains its own detailed README, documentation, and license file.

*   ### **[Lark Hardware](https://github.com/hamslices/LarkHardware)**
    This repository contains all the hardware design files for the Lark controller PCB. The board is specifically designed to interface with and control the Fujitsu FTP-68EMCL112-R thermal printer mechanism. You will also find 3D CAD models for enclosures and other mechanical parts here.

*   ### **[Lark Firmware](https://github.com/hamslices/LarkFirmware)**
    Here you will find the source code for the firmware that runs on the Lark controller board. This is the core print engine that interprets commands and drives the printer mechanism.

*   ### **[Lark API](https://github.com/hamslices/LarkAPI)**
    This repository houses a C++ API for Windows. It provides a set of functions and libraries for developers to integrate and control the Lark print engine from their own Windows applications.

*   ### **[Lark Tool (CLI) (Sample APP)](https://github.com/hamslices/LarkTool)**
    For those who prefer working from the command line, `LarkTool` is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with and controlling the printer. It's perfect for scripting, testing, and automation.

*   ### **[Lark GUI (Sample APP)](https://github.com/hamslices/LarkGUI)**
    This repository contains the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Lark printer. It provides a user-friendly, visual way to control the printer's functions without needing to write code or use the command line.
