# Sponsor the Lark Project: From Design to Reality

The Lark Project has reached its most exciting milestone. The hardware and mechanical designs are complete, and we're ready to build the first official, physical prototype. This is the critical step to validate the entire system and create a proven, open-source foundation for everyone to build upon.

Your sponsorship directly funds the components needed to bring this project to life.

## 🎯 Our Immediate Goal: The First Prototype

Our primary funding goal is to acquire all the necessary components to build and document the first working Lark printer. This will transform the project from a set of design files into a tangible, tested reality.

### Funding Breakdown:

*   **Electronic Bill of Materials (BOM):** Funding for all the electronic components (microcontrollers, resistors, capacitors, etc.) to populate the custom controller PCB.
*   **Mechanical Hardware:** A complete set of the nuts, bolts, and fasteners required to assemble the printer's 3D-printed enclosure.
*   **Miscellaneous Supplies:** Essential items like wiring, connectors, and rolls of thermal paper for rigorous testing.

### What Your Support Delivers:

By helping us build the prototype, you enable the creation of:
*   ✅ **A fully validated and tested hardware design.**
*   ✅ **High-quality photos or videos** for clear assembly guides and documentation.
*   ✅ **A confirmed and verified Bill of Materials** for the community.
*   ✅ **The final, polished open-source release** that others can build with confidence.
